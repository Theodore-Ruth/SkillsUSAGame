# SkillsUSAGame
My Project with Amanda Thomas to make a game for Skills USA

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to launch my game, we reccomend that you have python3 IDLE
which can be installed here by folling the instructions on pythons website:

Windows and Mac: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/

Linux: install by typing "sudo apt-get install idle" into the terminal.

Once you have installed idle, simply download the repository as a zip,
open the zip file, and right click on the most recent .py file. Then open with
idle

After that, simply hit F5 on your keyboard and it will automatically run the file for you.
